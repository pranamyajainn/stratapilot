## Usage Guidelines

- **Historical Reference**: All reports are point-in-time snapshots. Check file dates and cross-reference with codebase state.
- **Append-Only**: Existing reports should never be modified. New work creates new files.
- **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames (e.g., `frontend-diagnostic-jan2026.md`)
- **Linking**: Use relative paths when referencing other documentation files

## Finding Documentation

1. **By Date**: Check subdirectory file modification dates
2. **By Topic**: Use directory structure to narrow search
3. **By Keyword**: Search within .md files for specific terms
